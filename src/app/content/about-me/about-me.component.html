                            <p>
                                IBM – August 2014 to August 2015 (12 moth placement as Trainee Software Engineer) * Role – My primary activity was as a tester
                                of the Customer Information Control System (CICS) Explorer system. However, following a comprehensive
                                period of training, I was tasked with developing a Health Checker program, split between
                                a server side application and client, which checks the health of the CICS systems and reports
                                the status via numerous forms of reporters with the use of the MQTT protocol. The reporters
                                included a Command Line Output, a TrayIcon and a GUI that is accessed via the TrayIcon. *
                                For the Giveback program, I joined a BlueFusion team. My team and I worked on improving the
                                Big Blue Rover (BBR) game that was made in previous years; I took responsibility for the
                                scoring system. For the main even I took on a couple of roles as an activity host for FortRon
                                and Evo Dino, presenting and guiding 4 schools of 6 kids, aged approximately 10 years old
                                through the games and as a tech support for BBR.
